to obtain the remainder of a division
print(10 % 3)
>>> 1 

convert a number to string
my_num = 10
print(str(my_num))

that help us when we combine a numbers with string:
my_num = 10
print(str(my_num + " favorite number") ... is wrong

instead:
my_num = 10
print(str(str(my_num) + " favorite number")) ... is correct :D
